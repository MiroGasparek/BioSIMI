*** TO DO LIST FOR BioSIMI MODELING FRAMEWORK ***

1. Enabling modeling of multiple input/multiple output behavior

2. Adding feature allowing for specifying of individual interconnected species (specified by the user)

3. Setting the strength of the interaction between the user-specified interconnected species (i. e. between 0 and 1 to determine the affinity)

4. Creation and simulation of simple metabolic framework allowing for extension of the lifetime of the TX-TL reaction

5. ??Implementation of the Vipul's MCMC alghoritm in the BioSIMI so that it is compatible with TX-TL modeling toolbox?? (TO BE CLARIFIED)

On-going task: debugging, improving robustness and increasing readability of the code
